How to start. Fork the project and clone it

`
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/React-Website-Template.git
`

or

`
gh repo clone <your-username>/React-Website-Template

Use `make build` to build your project as raw html. Update the project dependency using `make update`

To host to github get the dist from the `make build` command and put it in another branch called `build` and set the github page to build (not main or master!!)

For dependencies check Dependency.md
